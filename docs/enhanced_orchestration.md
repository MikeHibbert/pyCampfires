# Usage
async def run_enhanced_analysis():
    analyst = EnhancedAnalyst("Strategic Analyst", "business strategy")
    
    torch = Torch(
        campers=[analyst],
        campfire_name="strategic-analysis"
    )
    
    result = await torch.light(
        "Analyze the market opportunity for AI-powered customer service solutions"
    )
    
    print("Analysis complete! Check the generated HTML report.")
    return result
```

### Running Your First Enhanced Orchestration

```python
import asyncio

# Run the analysis
result = asyncio.run(run_enhanced_analysis())

# The system automatically generates:
# 1. strategic-analysis_report_[timestamp].html - Interactive HTML report

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Design for Enhanced Orchestration

- **Structure your prompts** with clear sections (Problem Understanding, Approach Selection, etc.)
- **Include metadata requests** to capture decision rationale
- **Use consistent formatting** across different agents
- **Specify quality criteria** and validation requirements

### 2. Agent Configuration

- **Define clear roles** and expertise areas for each agent
- **Set appropriate confidence levels** based on task complexity
- **Include personality traits** that influence decision-making
- **Configure error handling** for robust operation

### 3. Report Utilization

- **Review execution stages** to understand agent reasoning
- **Check quality considerations** for validation insights
- **Examine risk assessments** for potential issues
- **Use metadata** for debugging and optimization

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Limit concurrent agents** to manage resource usage
- **Use appropriate model sizes** for your use case
- **Cache frequently used contexts** for RAG integration
- **Monitor execution times** and optimize as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Reports Not Generated
- **Check file permissions** in the project directory
- **Verify campfire naming** (avoid special characters)
- **Ensure proper async execution** of torch.light()

#### Low Confidence Scores
- **Review prompt structure** for clarity
- **Check agent expertise alignment** with task requirements
- **Validate input data quality** and completeness

#### Missing Execution Stages
- **Verify enhanced_orchestration metadata** is set to True
- **Check prompt formatting** for required sections
- **Ensure proper error handling** in override_prompt

#### Performance Issues
- **Reduce concurrent agents** if experiencing slowdowns
- **Optimize prompt length** for faster processing
- **Use appropriate model selection** for your use case

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Your enhanced orchestration code here
```
