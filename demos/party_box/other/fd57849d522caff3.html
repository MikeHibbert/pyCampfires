  <h2>üìñ The Experience Story</h2>
  
        <p><strong>Alex faced a difficult day with multiple stressors.</strong> The environment was noisy and distracting, 
        making concentration challenging. Two job rejections arrived, triggering feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. 
        Additionally, pending issues with their landlord created housing insecurity anxiety.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Throughout the experience:</strong> Alex felt their stress levels <span class="impact-negative">increase</span> 
        and optimism <span class="impact-negative">decrease</span>. The challenging conditions activated trauma responses, 
        including hypervigilance and emotional dysregulation. However, they demonstrated resilience by implementing 
        learned coping strategies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key moments:</strong> The rejections initially felt overwhelming, but Alex recognized the trauma response 
        and engaged breathing exercises. The housing concerns added complexity, but they managed to compartmentalize and 
        focus on actionable job search steps.</p>
