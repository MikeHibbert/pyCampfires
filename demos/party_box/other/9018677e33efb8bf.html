  <h2>ðŸ“– The Experience Story</h2>
  
        <p><strong>Alex experienced a typical day with balanced conditions.</strong> The environment was neither particularly 
        supportive nor challenging - just an average day in their job search journey. They submitted one application and 
        had no major positive or negative events to process.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Throughout the experience:</strong> Alex maintained <span class="impact-neutral">stable</span> stress and 
        optimism levels. This represented a healthy baseline day where trauma responses remained manageable and they could 
        engage in consistent, sustainable job search activities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key moments:</strong> The steady progress felt reassuring. Alex was able to maintain their routine without 
        significant emotional peaks or valleys, demonstrating growing emotional regulation skills.</p>
